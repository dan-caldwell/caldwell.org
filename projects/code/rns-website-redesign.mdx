I rebuilt and redesigned the entire <Anchor href="https://religionnews.com">ReligionNews.com</Anchor> frontend. ReligionNews.com gets over 2 million page views a month, so we needed a fast, highly SEO optimized site. The new frontend’s page speed is 2x faster than the previous site and SEO has been improved 15% — helping to double our Alexa ranking. The new site also has many UX improvements.
