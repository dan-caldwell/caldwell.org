In the spring of 2018, I launched Creamy Graphics (now defunct). I specialized in experimental graphic art and design. Creamy Graphics was the brand I was using as an intermediary between dan.wf (my old, old website) and dcald (my new brand). Creamy Graphics didn’t last all that long, but I did enjoy the branding process.
